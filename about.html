        What is a Pit Bull?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Today there are at least five breeds of dogs that are commonly misidentified and lumped into the category of the
        pitbull-type dogs: the English bull terrier, the American bulldog, the boxer, the American pit bull terrier and
        the
        American Staffordshire terrier.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many different breeds and combinations can look like a “pit bull.” In fact many dogs that are well known and
        loved, after being DNA tested, are lumped into the pit bull category. Some common breeds such as: cocker
        spaniel,
        boxer, golden
        retriever, bulldog,
        German shepherd, Boston terrier, and many other breeds in their heritage. For some dogs, assigning just one main
        breed
        is difficult.
      </p>

      <h3 class="name-origin">
        Where did the name come from?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The term “pit bull” originated in the British Isles in the early 1800s when the sport “bull baiting”
        emerged.
        Bull baiting involved tying a bull to an iron stake that gave him about a 30-foot radius in which to move.
        Blowing
        the
        bull’s nose full of pepper to enrage the animal was also done to add to the whole affair. Then dogs were set on
        him
        to immobilize the bull for the public's
        entertainment.
